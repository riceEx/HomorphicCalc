# Homomorphic Encrypted Average Calculator (Toy Version)

This project simulates a privacy-preserving way to compute the average of user-submitted data (like salaries) using a toy homomorphic encryption scheme.

## Files
- `participant.py`: Simulates user encryption
- `surveyor.py`: Collects encrypted data and computes the average
- `main.py`: Runs the simulation

## How to Run
```bash
python3 main.py
